## Building

To setup a build environment, first boot the Vagrant VM:

```
$ vagrant up
```

Once finished, shell into the VM:

```
$ vagrant ssh
```

Inside the Vagrant machine, install ruby gem dependencies:

```
# TODO
```

Finally, run `TODO` to build the project and its scripts:

```
# TODO
```

All relevant project scripts will now be found in `bin/`.
